## House prices prediction with Machine Learning in Python
In this project I tackled a Kaggle dataset. The aim is to predict Melbourne house prices. After a robust exploratory data analysis and feature engineering effort, I compared three models in terms of RMSE and MAPE: logistic regression, decision trees and Random forest. Then I fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the best models, which was random forest, using both a grid search and a randomized search.
